 * Base class for the sound designs. There are a collection of soundtracks that will play and represent shapes and
 * geometric properties. The sounds play in the background and loop forever, but their output level will change
 * depending on shape state and user input. By default, sound will only play for a few seconds after input with the
 * quadrilateral.
 *
 * Subclasses of this sound view will provide all the tracks to play and implement how their output level
 * should change with state of the shape.
